The additions I added were added in the interests of simplicity. Normally I would add a sidebar but as work compounded throughout the week, I had to go for something simpler to implement. The nav tags were intuitive as navigation should be labeled as such. I added the iframe tag as embedded media seemed logical as the next step. Also embedded media might come up when designing my own website, so I thought I should add it now. The center tag was added so that I didnt need to style out a separate container. The form and input tags were for user input if I could link this to databases in the future.

Homework 5:
The reason why an external stylesheet is used is because it would load independently of the site. Thus less resources would need to be spent on loading your website. However, internal stylesheets do not face the rendering problem of a failed loading or external sites going down. There are still no problems that I encountered with rendering. Soon I will need to restructure my website to be a personal site. I also personally do not like webpack and frame animations so I cannot use that for my personal site. 

Homework 6:
Since I am deciding to make my site themed around Magic the Gathering, it seemed intuitive to make my banner using the iconic Magic the Gathering card back. I used a 1000 px by 200 px canvas and 6 copies of the card back given from Wizards of the Coast, the creators of Magic the Gathering. The card back is owned by Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast. I sacrificed resolution for design and repetition since the card back should still be recognizable enough to anyone who has seen the card back. The main a-ha moment actually came up due to me arbitrating a Magic the Gathering tournament this Saturday and my love of the game. It was at that moment that I knew that the site should be about Magic the Gathering.
