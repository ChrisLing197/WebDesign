The majority of my testing went into webkit and keyframes. I thought a slideshow of the basic lands of Magic the Gathering might be a good inclusion to my website but it seems that the transitions are not smooth enough to satisfy me. I do not know if this is just due to my lack of experience with the animation keyframes or if this would be better suited another way. I liked the fact that I could rotate the images almost like a slideshow but obviously the fluency is lacking, at least in my opinion. If I could figure out how the keyframes can become smoother whether through transitions or different steps, I might attempt that then put the animation on the live site. The only change that is visible is the image of the card that changes every 5 seconds. I already have familiarity with responsive web design through the bootstrap framework. Since I am not working with forms and do not need dynamic pages, I thought it unnecessary to work on that as opposed to elements of HTML5.
