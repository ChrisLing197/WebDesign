                Simply Ramen is devoted to the perfectionism of tonkotsu style ramen. Based on years of 
                research, Simply Ramen unveils their innovations to the popular pork bone broth. They
                were able to infuse pork, chicken and fish stock in order to create the most delectable
                mixture perfect in tandem with their hand pulled noodles.
