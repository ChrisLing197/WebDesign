The choices I made were mainly to mimic the websites of popular ramen restaurants that I have eaten at. The homepage functions like the news and about us pages, and could be extended to include a twitter feed to show reviews. The inclusion of a food challenge was a spontaneous addition as food challenges usually draws some customers. Whether people want the thrill of competing, the thrill of succeeding or just eating casually, all venues should be covered. 
The contact me and application page were built simply for function as php is not covered in the course (and finding a mailhosting server is a pain). The menu would be better served in a table but lists were required for this component.
